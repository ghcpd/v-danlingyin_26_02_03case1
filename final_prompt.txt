Fix API docstrings during codegen - Fix wildcards in settings API doc
Issue Description
The pyfluent project has a bug where wildcards (asterisks *) in docstrings are not properly escaped when generating documentation for the settings API. This causes issues during documentation generation because unescaped asterisks are interpreted as markdown/reStructuredText formatting characters (like bold or italic markers).

For example, a docstring like:

Read boundary profile data (*.prof, *.csv). Default is *.prof.
Should be escaped to:

Read boundary profile data (\*.prof, \*.csv). Default is \*.prof.
Your Task
You need to modify the fix_doc.py file to add a function that escapes wildcards (asterisks) in docstrings, and update the fix_settings_doc() function to use this new escape function.

Files to Modify
The following files need to be modified (located in the fixed_before folder):

fix_doc.py (source path: src/ansys/fluent/core/utils/fix_doc.py)
test_fix_doc.py (source path: tests/test_fix_doc.py)
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Backup Instructions
Before making any changes to the source files, you MUST:

Create a backup copy of each file you're about to modify
Name the backup with a .bak suffix (e.g., fix_doc.py.bak)
Only then proceed with your modifications
Required Changes
1. Changes to fix_doc.py
Add a new function escape_wildcards(doc: str) that:

Takes a docstring as input
Iterates through each character in the docstring
When it encounters an asterisk (*) that is not already escaped (i.e., not preceded by a backslash \), it escapes it by adding a backslash before it
Returns the modified docstring with all wildcards properly escaped
Then modify the fix_settings_doc(doc: str) function to:

First call escape_wildcards(doc) on the input docstring
Then pass the result to fix_definition_list_in_class_doc()
Return the final result
You will also need to import StringIO from io module for efficient string building.

Example implementation approach:

from io import StringIO

def escape_wildcards(doc: str):
    new_doc = StringIO()
    prev_c = None
    for i, c in enumerate(doc):
        if c == "*" and prev_c != "\\":
            new_doc.write("\\*")  # Escape the asterisk
        else:
            new_doc.write(c)
        prev_c = c
    return new_doc.getvalue()

def fix_settings_doc(doc: str):
    doc = escape_wildcards(doc)
    return fix_definition_list_in_class_doc(doc)
2. Changes to test_fix_doc.py
Rename the existing test function from test_fix_settings_doc() to test_fix_definition_list_in_settings_doc() to better describe what it's testing.

Add a new test function test_fix_wildcards_in_settings_doc() that:

Tests the wildcard escaping functionality
Uses a docstring containing wildcards like *.prof and *.csv
Verifies that the wildcards are properly escaped in the output
Example test:

def test_fix_wildcards_in_settings_doc():
    old_doc = """Read boundary profile data (*.prof, *.csv). Default is *.prof."""
    new_doc = fix_settings_doc(old_doc)
    assert (
        new_doc
        == r"""Read boundary profile data (\*.prof, \*.csv). Default is \*.prof."""
    )
Expected Outcome
After your changes:

The escape_wildcards() function should properly escape all unescaped asterisks in docstrings
The fix_settings_doc() function should first escape wildcards, then fix definition lists
The new test should pass, verifying the wildcard escaping works correctly
The existing test (now renamed) should still pass
Verification
Run the tests to verify your changes work:

pytest tests/test_fix_doc.py -v
Both tests should pass:

test_fix_definition_list_in_settings_doc - Tests the definition list formatting
test_fix_wildcards_in_settings_doc - Tests the wildcard escaping
